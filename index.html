                        After the whirlwind that was the pandemic, Nam has finally arrived in Lille, France.<br/>
                        He is rather concerned, however, because changing his diet to adapt to a new region can be tough.
                        Help Nam decide on what to eat in 5 consecutive days! If the meal plan you make for him satisfies him well,
                        he will surely have a wonderful time studying abroad. <br> Scroll down for more information.

                <p style="line-height: 200%;">Create many types of dishes with the available ingredients.<br/>
                    However, once one ingredient is used for a dish, it cannot be used again for the next day. Nam
                    lives very far away from the nearest supermarket. He will have to wait until the weekend to replenish his stock.<br/>
                    Nam is a student so there are only cheap ingredients. Different dishes satisfy Nam differently, so pay attention to what type you are creating!

                    strong before the trip! Don't make him eat things that will make him sick at home! Good luck!
